# Weather Dashboard üå§Ô∏è

This Weather Dashboard is a React application that allows users to search for the weather forecast of a city and displays both the current weather and a 5-day forecast. The app uses the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data and supports temperature-based dynamic styling for a visually engaging experience.
